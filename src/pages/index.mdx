## About

We are organizing this brownbag to create a space for graduate students and post-docs to present their work to their peers. We encourage folks to submit work in all stages - from new ideas to job market papers. Our goals is to create connections across schools, exchange ideas with others in our field, and get constructive feedback.

Our plan is to host a weekly brownbag for 10-15 weeks each semester (depending on the demand). We are currently looking for proposals for the spring semester and will be accepting submissions until January 15<sup>th</sup>.
